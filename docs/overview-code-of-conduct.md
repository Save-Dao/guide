Before we dive in, here is a quick code of conduct to keep in mind:

  * **Professionalism** - We prioritize shipping at all costs. Our main goal is to meet deadlines and deliver valuable output in a timely manner. If you commit to a Save, you should be prepared to do anything and everything to make sure it gets done.

  * **Respect** -  Save Dao is a no-beef zone, meaning that we do not discriminate and expect you to withhold all judgement while interacting in or with Save Dao.

  * **Collaboration** - Save Dao is meant to foster new relationships. Please be open to inviting new members to your Save as you’re likely to be pleasantly surprised by what you find.

  * **Honor** - Becoming a member of Save Dao is no easy feat. We ask that all those involved with Save Dao treat our brand as a seal of honor. This means being kind to others inquiring about the Dao, and speaking favorably about it when presenting on behalf of the Dao in public. If there is something you do not like about the Dao, please vocalize it internally so that we can do our best to resolve it.

  * **Free Speech** - Save Dao is an idea meritocracy. We invite you to share your opinion. In fact, we encourage contentious opinions so long as they are presented in a constructive manner.


With that, let’s learn about the Save Dao!
