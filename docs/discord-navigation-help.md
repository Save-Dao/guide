Thereâ€™s a lot going on in our Discord. Please never hesitate to ask questions if you get lost. The best place to do so is in <span class='channels'>#Tavern</span> as an Apprentice or in <span class='channels'>#general</span> or <span class='channels'>#ops</span> as a Guilder.

If you have yet to receive a response about your Discord question, search by the **@Tavern Keeper** Role and ping them along with your question. If you do not receive a response from a **@Tavern Keeper**, feel free to DM them. However, we encourage all questions to remain in public channels for future conversations and reference.
