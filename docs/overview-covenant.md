Section 4(a)(ii), solely as to themselves and without any adverse effect on other
Members, to the extent expressly provided in a written legal agreement, provided that the
execution of such agreement is announced to all Members and an accurate and

Legal Proceeding or Order in rem pertaining to the Trust Property or any Legal

if there is a Material Adverse Exception Event, then the rules and procedures set forth in this

Adverse Exception Event, such Member (the “Sending Member”) shall deliver to the
other Members (the “Receiving Members”) a notice (an “Exception Notice”):

Material Adverse Exception Event;
(B) describing in reasonable detail the events, facts, circumstances and reasons
forming the basis of such belief;

benefit of the Receiving Members with the understanding that the Receiving
Members will rely thereon, that, to the Sending Member’s knowledge, the
certification and statements made pursuant to the preceding clauses “(A)” and “(B)”
are accurate as of the date of the Exception Notice, and, considered collectively, do
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make such statements, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading.
(ii) Exception Standstill. During the period starting on the date of delivery of an
Exception Notice and ending with the Members entering into an Exception Handling
Addendum or receiving a final decision of an arbitrator in accordance with Section 4(b)(iii)
(the “Standstill Period”), each Member shall: (A) treat all of the Distributed Trust
Property of such Member that may have been Transferred to such Member as a
result of the Material Adverse Exception Event as if it were Trust Property, including by
disregarding the parenthetical exceptions for Distributed Trust Property in Section 4(a)(iii);
and (B) deposit and maintain such Distributed Trust Property in a segregated Account
Address to be treated, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, as a

Charter setting forth the Members’ agreement on the existence or non-existence
of a Material Adverse Exception Event and the actions to be taken, the agreements to
be entered into, and the remedies to be sought in response thereto. Each Exception
Handling Addendum shall automatically and without further action of the Trust
Members be deemed incorporated into and to form a part of this Charter.
(B) During the continuous 10-day period beginning on the date of delivery of
the Exception Notice (the “Negotiation Period”), the Members shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith to agree upon the existence
or non-existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event and, if so agreed, the actions
to be taken, the agreements to be entered into and the remedies to be sought by the
Members in response to the Material Adverse Exception Event. If the 
Members agree upon such matters during the Negotiation Period, the Members
shall promptly enter into an Exception Handling Addendum reflecting the same.
(C) If the Trust Members fail to reach an agreement resulting in an Exception
Handling Addendum during the Negotiation Period, then either Member may
initiate an arbitration action to resolve the issues in accordance with the procedures
set forth at https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf (the
“Arbitration Procedures”). The decision resulting from the Arbitration Procedures
shall include, among any other determinations, a determination of the treatment of any
Distributed Trust Property and whether to extend, modify or terminate the covenants
applying to the Distributed Trust Property during the Standstill Period. The decision
resulting from the Arbitration Procedures shall be non- appealable, binding and
conclusive upon the Members. Judgment upon such a decision may be entered
in any court of competent jurisdiction.
