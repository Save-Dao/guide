Greetings!

We see you’ve stumbled across the Grimoire. For our purposes here (if you don't know what "grimoire" means), we will use this definition:

   "A book of magical knowledge, especially one containing spells."
    The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition.
    
Well done! This guide will serve as your go-to resource for any and all things Adbongo Org. Here we will spell out our operating manual.  It is a work in progress, so please forgive any errors as we figure out what we are doing. 

If you’ve made it this far we can tell you’re interested in joining (or have already 
joined) our decentralized collective of freelancers with the magical powers to manifest the golden age. Because the code to this matrix is 
often made buy judges, and legislative bodies.  We include legal engineering, in addition to our tech offerings.  If you need resources for your project perhaps we can help.
