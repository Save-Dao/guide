To advance from an Apprentice to a Member, you will need to be Championed by an existing Save Dao Member. Once you find a Champion, you can stake "Super" $SAVEx Tokens with he/she.  These wrapped erc20 (Ethereum) tokens are integral to our platform.  We call these "super", based on the recent implementation of the [superfluid protocol](./superfluid-protocol). See the [Champion a New Member](./champion-a-member) for how this works.

Once youâ€™ve found a Champion, you are eligible to level up from an Apprentice to a Member - signalled by 44 $SAVEx superfluid (streamable) shares (as opposed to 1). Here's what to do:

Follow the [Proposal Process](./proposal-types) and use the Membership Proposal to request the difference in Shares to get to your 40 Share cap in the [Save Dao](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x48cf4a3c08603f196be531ee1558b6aa641733c7/). In the description of your proposal, enter a blockscout link to the staking transaction that your Champion gives you. This is how the DAO will validate that your Champion made the appropriate stake.

Please note that all new members are capped at 44 Shares for 440 wxDAI.

Once your proposal has passed and been processed, you'll now have 44 Super Shares and full membership in Save Dao

To ensure that your Champion gets their $save stake back, you'll need to fulfill the following **within your first 60 days** as a member (starting from when your membership proposal is processed):
1. Successfully complete all the quests here (https://save-dao.crew3.xyz/questboard)
2. Contribute to an approved $SAVE Campaign, or bring us a paid project proposal.
4. Attend at least 4 [Dao meetings](./community-meetings), including Zoom Roundtables and the "Campfire" stage in discord.
5. Demonstrate shared values with the Dao (at the discretion of the DAO).
