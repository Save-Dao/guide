To advance from an Apprentice to a Member, you will need to be Championed by an existing Save Dao Member. Once you find a Champion, there are a few Your champion will need to put down a stake of $save tokens. See the [Champion a New Member](./champion-a-member) for how this works.

Once youâ€™ve found a Champion, you are eligible to level up from an Apprentice to a Member - signalled by 144 Shares as opposed to 1. Here's what to do:

Follow the [Proposal Process](./proposal-types) and use the Membership Proposal to request the difference in Shares to get to your 144 Share cap in the [Save Dao](https://xdai.colony.io/colony/save/0x701ec7674e59E0986146CF53ab2DFc59706ce62C). In the description of your proposal, enter a blockscout link to the staking transaction that your Champion gives you. This is how the DAO will validate that your Champion made the appropriate stake.

Please note that all new members are capped at 144 Shares for 500 wxDAI.

Once your proposal has passed and been processed, you'll now have 100 Shares and full membership in Save Dao!

To get access to member-exclusive channels in the Save Dao [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yarBYA9yx9), head to the <span class='channels'>#member-join</span> channel and enter the `!join` command. Then follow the CollabLand instructions to get your `@Save Dao Member` role. Now you're ready to [join a save](./join-a-save)!

To ensure that your Champion gets their $save stake back, you'll need to fulfill the following [3 criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria) **within your first 60 days** as a member (starting from when your membership proposal is processed):
1. Successfully join at least 1 [save](./join-a-save) or [RIP](./rips). This include saves or RIPs completed within the first 60 days as well as saves or RIPs still in progress (provided that you are in good standing on that project).
2. Attend at least 2 [Dao meetings](./community-meetings), including Roundtable and the "Dao-dreaming" stage in discord.
3. Demonstrate shared values with the Dao (at the discretion of the DAO).
