The best place to Summon new Members for a SAVE is in the DAO DISCORD HQ <span class='channels'>#save-campaign</span> channel by tagging the roles in question.

Please give a realistic expectation of expected hours, a generalized overview on the SAVE (including the client name + project), and budget. The more detail you can provide - the easier it will be to find a SAVE Campaign.

Outside of <span class='channels'>#save-campaign</span> you may also look in <span class='channels'>#general</span> or scour active Channels to find Members which best suite your needs.

If all else fails, please find a Wizard to help you establish a SAVE Campaign, and be sure to draw from Apprentices to fill gaps as needed.

DO NOT START A SAVE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE PROPER TEAM IN PLACE.
