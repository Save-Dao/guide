You can join the Discord [here](https://discord.gg/RWjkQ6DNnv), If you have been assigned a “Raid Guild Member” role, then you will be able to access all of Raid Guild’s internal channels. 

If you are **not** a Raid Guild member, we recommend you check out `[Becoming An Apprentice](https://handbook.raidguild.org/docs/discord-getting-started)` first.  If admitted to the Raid Guild as an apprentice, you’ll have the opportunity to prove your talent and level up in the DAO as you complete tasks, unlocking access to new private channels.  This will allow you to take on bigger Raids and contribute to shaping the Guild as we know it today.

### Starting in Discord

If you haven't already introduced yourself, the first place you’ll want to make yourself known is <span class='channels'>#Tavern</span> - where you can introduce yourself, your hobbies and your strengths.

From here, you’ll want to start earning some rep in the Guild by tackling open Apprentice issues in the <span class='channels'>#projects</span> channel.

You’ll notice there are a few <span class='channels'>#apprentice channels</span> where you can meet and interact with other Guilders, making your presence known in the Raid Guild.

Long story short, you’ll need to work your way into the Guild, so the more issues you tackle to improve the Guild, the quicker you’ll receive a share! (and become part of the Guild).
