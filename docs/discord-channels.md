Within the Save Dao Discord, you’ll notice a suite of Categories each full of different sub-channels. Here’s what you need to know about each.  You can join discord here:  (https://discord.gg/G2sXhQCpGg)

## Public

Public channels are available to everyone in the Discord. This offers a crossing ground for Apprentices and Daoers and is largely recreational. Daoers should keep a close eye on <span class='channels'>#projects</span> as this is where Apprentices are earning their chops and contributing to better refine the Dao.

## Season(n) COMING SOON

Seasons are a method of engagement that were introduced by Dao members in February of 2021.  The purpose of Seasons are to make sure that everyone who joins the Dao gains equal footing when beginning to take on projects and tasks within Save Dao.  The way Seasons does this is to onboard new apprentices in waves to ensure that there is no information gaps between what Apprentices know and what Members know.

## Dao HQ 

HQ is where we discuss Save Dao Improvements and is a place where a variety of conversations take place.  Daoers chat with one another about general Save questions and feedback, discuss Client submissions and find new Daoers to form a Save Party. If you’re looking for people to help you on your Save, Dao HQ is a great first place to start.  Dao HQ is also where you’ll look when chatting about anything to help make Save Dao better than it is today.

Got an idea for how to improve Save Dao with an internal Save? Check out <span class='channels'>#rip-discussion</span> to make a Save Improvement Proposal (RIP) and get feedback and soft consensus form other Daoers.

### Active Saves/RIPs

This is where all active Saves are listed. You will notice each subchannel starts with <span class='channels'>#Save</span> signalling it is an ongoing engagement. Each Save is given a unique name and a pinned message which describes what the Save is about.

Keen to get involved with a given Save? Slide through the subchannel and politely ask where you can add value. More times than not Saves can always use an extra hand!

| Name                          | Visibility   | Purpose                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _#[Save-project/rip-project]_ | Members Only | Projects you’re working on go here. Each channel requires a pinned message so other members know what the Save entails. |

### Client Chats

As we sort out an engagement with a client, we may open a Client Chat subchannel to discuss the scope and figure out exactly what is needed. Client chats are a great way to get some visibility into who’s on the other side of a Save, and their tone, expectations and budget for an ongoing Save.

Not all Saves have a Client Chat in Discord, as many times this happens outside of Discord on platforms like Telegram. Please respect that all Client Chats are proprietary and that any information taken from Client Chats and used maliciously may result in a permanent banning from Save Dao.

| Name                | Visibility   | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| _#[client-project]_ | Members Only | Client and team discussions before starting the Save. |
