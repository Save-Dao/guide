Within the Raid Guild Discord, you’ll notice a suite of Categories each full of different sub-channels. Here’s what you need to know about each.

## Public

Public channels are available to everyone in the Discord. This offers a crossing ground for Apprentices and Guilders and is largely recreational. Guilders should keep a close eye on <span class='channels'>#projects</span> as this is where Apprentices are earning their chops and contributing to better refine the Guild.

## Season(n)

Seasons are a method of engagement that were introduced by Guild members in February of 2021.  The purpose of Seasons are to make sure that everyone who joins the Guild gains equal footing when beginning to take on projects and tasks within Raid Guild.  The way Seasons does this is to onboard new apprentices in waves to ensure that there is no information gaps between what Apprentices know and what Members know.

## Guild HQ 

HQ is where we discuss Raid Guild Improvements and is a place where a variety of conversations take place.  Guilders chat with one another about general Raid questions and feedback, discuss Client submissions and find new Guilders to form a Raid Party. If you’re looking for people to help you on your Raid, Guild HQ is a great first place to start.  Guild HQ is also where you’ll look when chatting about anything to help make Raid Guild better than it is today.

### Active Raids/RIPs

This is where all active Raids are listed. You will notice each subchannel starts with <span class='channels'>#raid</span> signalling it is an ongoing engagement. Each Raid is given a unique name and a pinned message which describes what the Raid is about.

Keen to get involved with a given Raid? Slide through the subchannel and politely ask where you can add value. More times than not Raids can always use an extra hand!

| Name                          | Visibility   | Purpose                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _#[raid-project/rip-project]_ | Members Only | Projects you’re working on go here. Each channel requires a pinned message so other members know what the raid entails. |

### Client Chats

As we sort out an engagement with a client, we may open a Client Chat subchannel to discuss the scope and figure out exactly what is needed. Client chats are a great way to get some visibility into who’s on the other side of a Raid, and their tone, expectations and budget for an ongoing Raid.

Not all Raids have a Client Chat in Discord, as many times this happens outside of Discord on platforms like Telegram. Please respect that all Client Chats are proprietary and that any information taken from Client Chats and used maliciously may result in a permanent banning from Raid Guild.

| Name                | Visibility   | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| _#[client-project]_ | Members Only | Client and team discussions before starting the raid. |
