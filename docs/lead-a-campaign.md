Well well well! Welcome to the big leagues.

Looks like you’ve decided to step your Saving up a level!

As a Leader of a Campaign, you will bear the responsibility of seeing it through from start to finish - through the good, the bad and the ugly. As emphasized in our code of conduct we prioritize shipping at all costs. This often means you’ll need to go above and beyond to make sure all gaps are filled.

Where leading certain Campaigns may not have hard coded economic benefits, you do stand to earn a DAO Badge for successfully completing your first Campaign. To Lead a Campaign, please do the following:

1. Ensure the Campaign is logged in Airtable as `Campaigning`.
2. Find a **Cleric** (Account Manager) and a **Monk** (Project Manager) responsible for interfacing with the client. If you wish to perform these aspects yourself, please self-assign yourself the role.
3. Signal that you will be leading a Campaign either during Round Table or by posting in Guild HQ <span class='channels'>#general</span>.
4. Establish a Scope of Work for the Campaign. This task is generally handled by Clerics or Monks, but in the case this is you, please ensure a timeline, scope and budget is properly laid out to ensure expectations are aligned. An outline of a Scope of Work can be found [here](https://github.com/Campaign-guild/HQ/blob/master/Templates/Proposal.md).
5. Create a Campaign Party using Guild HQ <span class='channels'>#who-is-available</span> and tagging the relevant roles like **Archer** (Design) or **Paladin** (Back-end)
6. If a Client Chat has not been started, please **start one** using the project name so others can easily identify the Campaign. (i.e. <span class='channels'>#aave</span>)
7. Start a <span class='channels'>#Campaign</span> channel and ensure access is restricted only to Campaign Guild Members and Apprentices. Please reference the permissions of other Campaign Channels for guidance
8. While not mandatory, we strongly recommend setting up a [Gnosis Safe Multisig Wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/) for your Campaign Party to accept client payment. This ensures that funding can be allocated and distributed with consensus from all participants.
9. We also recommend using the [Campaign Guid Escrow service](./escrow) to facilitate payments from the client.

For those looking for guidance on how to structure a Campaign bounty, here’s what we suggest:

-   10% War Chest Treasury &mdash; _mandatory_
-   5% Hunter (Biz Dev)
-   10% Cleric (Account Manager)
-   15% Monk (Project Manager)
-   60% Project (Wizard, Paladin, Archer, etc.)

This is meant to be a framework and as such, different Campaign breakdowns may vary. All that we ask is that a minimum of 10% of Campaign work is tributed back to the War Chest upon completion.
