Adbongo Org grows organically, adding new members as individual existing members deem appropriate and champion them in. Our championing process relies both on the Champion being a good judge of who is a good fit for the Dao as well as on the Championâ€™s reputation within the Dao being at stake.

In addition to reputation, to ensure that we are only bringing the highests quality new members, Champions must also put down $SAVEx as a semi-financial stake.

We also recognize that Championing involves a degree of mentorship. To encourage and compensate Champions for their mentorship of new members, Champions of successful new members will receive a $SAVEx reward in addition to receiving back their original stake.

### $SAVEx Staking 

To champion a new member, a Champion must stake $SAVEx. The stake amount depends on the type of applicant:
* If the applicant has finished one of the Adbongo Org Cohorts, the required stake is `x $SAVEx` TBD
    * Exception: if the Champion is from the same cohort season as the applicant, the required stake is the same as for non-cohort applicants.
* If not, the required stake is `x(x2) $SAVEx` TBD 

The Champion will receive their stake back if the new member meets the [success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria) outlined below.

### $Save Reward

Champions receive a reward of `44 SAVEx` if their new member meets [success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria) outlined below.

### Success Criteria

New members are successful when they contribute to the Adbongo Org community, bring in value to the Dao, and earn income for themselves.

Within the first 60 days after their membership proposal is processed, new members must:

 - Successfully complete all the [quests](https://save-dao.crew3.xyz/questboard)
 - Contribute to an approved $SAVE Campaign, or bring us a paid project proposal worth 5000+xdai. (first 10 waived)
 - Attend at least 4 Dao meetings, including Zoom Roundtables and the "Campfire" stage in discord.
 - Demonstrate shared values with the Dao (at the discretion of the DAO).

### Championing Process
Follow these steps to Champion in a new member:

1. Stake the appropriate amount of $SAVEx by transferring the $SAVEx to the `savex gnosis minion` minion at this address: `0x474a5dd9bbd789e9070e8f3b9daa7da27b37b8c7`.
2. Send the blockscout transaction url for your stake transaction to the applicant.
3. Have the applicant submit a membership proposal to the DAO and include the stake transaction url in the proposal description.
4. If/once the proposal passes and is processed, help the new member get onboarded and engaged in Dao activities.
5. Record your new member's activity related to the new member [success criteria](./champion-a-member#Success-Criteria).
6. If/once your new member has met the new member criteria, make a proposal requesting your original stake plus your reward from the `savex gnosis minion` minion. Your proposal should include proof of the new member's achievements against the success criteria. This is how the Dao will validate their success.s
