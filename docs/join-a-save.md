Any member with at least one Share is eligible to join an existing Raid.

Active Raids can be seen under the Raids channel. To join an existing Raid, please look for Guilders which are most active in the channel and shoot them a DM to discuss where you can add value.

We’d like to emphasize that jumping into a Raid without prior consent and context from existing members may be counterproductive, so please use the Raid channels and DM’s to get caught up to speed.

Seeing as the cost and budget of each Raid varies, please ensure that your expectations for payouts for completed tasks are discussed **prior** to work being performed.

For questions on how to price a given issue, please drop a note in <span class='channels'>#general</span>.
