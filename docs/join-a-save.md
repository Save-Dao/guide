Any member with at least one Share is eligible to join an existing campaign.

Active campaigns can be seen under the campaigns channel. To join an existing campaign, please look for Guilders which are most active in the channel and shoot them a DM to discuss where you can add value.

We’d like to emphasize that jumping into a campaign without prior consent and context from existing members may be counterproductive, so please use the campaign channels and DM’s to get caught up to speed.

Seeing as the cost and budget of each campaign varies, please ensure that your expectations for payouts for completed tasks are discussed **prior** to work being performed.

For questions on how to price a given issue, please drop a note in <span class='channels'>#general</span>.
