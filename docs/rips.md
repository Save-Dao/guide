### Apply for RIP Funding

Raid Guild Improvement Proposals, commonly referred to as “RIPs”, are an invaluable piece to ensuring that Raid Guild operates at its fullest capacity 24/7.  

RIPs are generally focused on Guild internal operations, but in some cases, RIPs have manifested in the Guild building open-source tools for the wider web3 ecosystem.  

[Smart Invoice](https://smartinvoice.xyz/) is a great example, as it began development as an internal tool (escrow) for Raiders to obtain payment from their clients.  

If this excites you, we encourage you to keep reading! 

Looking to receive funding for a Raid Guild Improvement Proposal (RIP)? We suggest receiving soft consensus from the DAO before putting anything onchain. The best way to do this is as follows:

-   Create an issue on the [RIPs Repo](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RIP&template=rip-request.md&title=) detailing why it benefits the DAO and how it will be executed.
-   Add the new issue to the [RIP Requests](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/projects/1) Project (or ask a keeper).
-   Share that request in Discord under the <span class='channels'>#rip-discussion</span> Guild HQ channel.

If you don’t yet have the talent you need to execute the RIP, make sure to drop a link to your proposal along with a brief TL;DR to the <span class='channels'>#who-is-available</span> channel and outline the different `roles` you need for the RIP.  Share the proposal during the weekly Roundtable for additional comments and feedback.

Once you have completed the preceding steps, double check to make sure you and your team have everything you need to make an official proposal to the DAO

Next, refer to the proposal process below to request funding for your RIP.

By following these steps, your proposal will receive far more feedback and have a much higher chance of being passed.
