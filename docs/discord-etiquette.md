Before we get down and dirty, you should know that discord is the central communications hub for all things Raid Guild.  With that in mind, there are some things you should know before you jump into the discord and begin taking up projects.

When you're perusing and communicating to Raid Guild members in the discord, it is of utmost importance that you are mindful of and respect other members by remembering the following: 

1. Do not spam channels by duplicating posts.
2. Do not spam members by tagging @Raid Guild Member more than once weekly.
3. Do not join or attempt to join member only meetings unless invited.
4. Make your best effort to post materials in channels that are relevant to the purpose of your post.
5. Engage in constructive communication with fellow Raiders, this means being respectful of others' ideas or opinions even though you may disagree with them.
