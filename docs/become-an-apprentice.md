Save Dao has instituted a new onboarding process through the utilization of Cohorts. 

As each cohort evolves, this process will change. In 2023.

_Note If Season(n) is in session or has not yet begun, we recommend that you find someone with the role @TavernKeeper to vouch for you and get you setup as an apprentice._

All new entries will start as an Apprentice. Apprentices  be upgraded to a member by pledging 440 wxDAI as tribute for 44 "Super" $SAVEx Shares after being championed. Here’s how it works:

1. Submit an application on the Save Dao homepage > [Join Us](www.zerowasteadvocacy.com).

    - Take your time filling out the Join Us form, as we will determine whether or not you’re a good fit for the Dao based on your ability to effectively communicate your skills and the value you will bring to the Dao as an Apprentice. Also, keep in mind that simply filling out the “Join Us” form does not guarantee you entry into Save Dao as an Apprentice.

2. Join the [Save Dao Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RWjkQ6DNnv) and introduce yourself in <span class='channels'>#tavern</span>. 
3. Showcase your past work and skills in <span class='channels'>#showcase</span>.
4. Poke around, and see where you can help to earn reputation.  
5. Once you prove yourself with the skills and reputation, a member of the Dao will signal your eligibility to receive your 1 Apprentice Share.
6. Submit a Membership Proposal for 1 Share with 0 Token Tribute in [Save Dao Guild](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xfe1084bc16427e5eb7f13fc19bcd4e641f7d571f).
7. Once the proposal passes, you will be given access to member exclusive channels.
8. For the remaining 99 shares to get yourself promoted from an Apprentice to Member, you will need to have worked on one Save or RIP (See How to Join a Save) and pledge with funds you earn while raiding or have at your disposal through other means.
9. A Member will oversee your progress and once it's done, you will be championed in <span class='channels'>#champions</span> as a signal for your remaining 99 share proposal.
10. Submit a Member Proposal for 44 Shares with 440 wxDAI Tribute in [Save Dao DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xfe1084bc16427e5eb7f13fc19bcd4e641f7d571f).
11. Once the proposal passes, you are now a full Save Dao Member.

_Note: In some cases, Members may earn shares for past work instead of pledging tribute. However, each Member is expected to contribute 440xDAI (or 440 wxdDAI worth of value) to the DAO in order to become a Member._
