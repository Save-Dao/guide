### Shipped

Once the client has paid the second half of the project, move the deal to `Shipped`.

### Finish a Raid

Once youâ€™ve delivered on your Scope of Work, please have a Cleric communicate directly with the Client to ensure final payment has been made.

When payment is received, the very first step is to deposit 10% of that Raid total back to the War Chest.

This can be done by sending wxDAI or WETH (or any whitelisted token) to the [DAO contract](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xfe1084bC16427e5EB7f13Fc19bCD4E641F7d571f) (0xfe10...571f) and posting in <span class='channels'>#did-a-thing</span> with the transaction hash. Soon this process will be automated to accommodate Raid Guildâ€™s `Escrow` feature.

While we can not force you to send 10% spoils back to the War Chest Raid Guild will remember your actions until you make amends with the DAO. If you do not have a compelling reason for refusing to pay 10% to the DAO, you stand to be stripped of your Raid Guild Membership.

Next, be sure to archive your Raid Channel by sending it to Valhalla, any guild member can send a raid channel to Valhalla (archive) by using <span class='channels'>#ðŸŽ®-command-center</span> with the following command, `@keeper valhalla #your-raid-channel-here`.
