### Step 2:
Visit https://dai-bridge.poa.network/

Once you are on the xDAI bridge site, you will see the amount of Dai you have on Ethereum Mainnet as well as the amount of xDAI that you have available on xDAI Chain. (You can easily navigate between xDai side chain and Ethereum Mainnet if you click on the networks tab your Metamask Wallet)

### Step 3:
In order to swap your Mainnet Dai for xDAI, you need to be connected to Ethereum Mainnet. If you want to swap your xDAI for DAI, you need to be connectec to xDAI Side chain.

**To swap your tokens enter the amount you are looking to swap and hit “transfer”.**
