There are a few meetings each week that we encourage all Dao Members to attend.  Save Rally is a meeting for Dao members to discuss progress across different RIPs and Saves, as well as provide teams in the _Preparing for Campaign phase with possible personnel for their Save/RIP. 

In addition to the Saveer Rally, each week Save Dao alternates between a Save Dao Futures meeting and a Round Table meeting.  The Futures meeting engages members in a discussion about the future of the Dao and it consequently seeks to align members in the longer-term vision for where we want to take Save Dao.  The Round Table is a meeting where we introduce new members, provide Save updates and discuss Save Dao improvement ideas.

If you have a share and would like an invite to the recurring Roundtable call, please drop a message in SaveHQ <span class='channels'>#general</span> channel so that someone can add you or just ask a @Tavern Keeper.

There is also a meeting set strictly for Happy-Hour in the Dao, which we strongly encourgae you join for it's cultural reconaissance.
