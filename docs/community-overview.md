There are a few meetings each week that we encourage all Guild Members to attend.  Raider Rally is a meeting for Guild members to discuss progress across different RIPs and Raids, as well as provide teams in the _Preparing for Battle_ phase with possible personnel for their Raid/RIP. 

In addition to the Raider Rally, each week Raid Guild alternates between a Raid Guild Futures meeting and a Round Table meeting.  The Futures meeting engages members in a discussion about the future of the guild and it consequently seeks to align members in the longer-term vision for where we want to take Raid Guild.  The Round Table is a meeting where we introduce new members, provide Raid updates and discuss Raid Guild improvement ideas.

If you have a share and would like an invite to the recurring Roundtable call, please drop a message in RaidHQ <span class='channels'>#general</span> channel so that someone can add you or just ask a @Tavern Keeper.

There is also a meeting set strictly for Happy-Hour in the Guild, which we strongly encourgae you join for it's cultural reconaissance.
