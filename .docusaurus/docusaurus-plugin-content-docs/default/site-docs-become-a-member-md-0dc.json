  "description": "To advance from an Sidekick to a Member, you will need to be Championed by an existing Save Dao Member. Once you find a Champion, you can stake \"Super\" $SAVEx Tokens with he/she.  These wrapped erc20 (Ethereum) tokens are integral to our platform.  We call these \"super\", based on the recent implementation of the superfluid protocol. See the Champion a New Member for how this works.",
