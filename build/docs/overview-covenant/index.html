or exercised by Trust Members through the Designated Smart Contract and Cryptographic
Consensus as further set forth in Section 4. The rights, powers and privileges of
Members are referred to herein as the “Membership Rights.”
(c) Status as a Member does not (and shall not be deemed to) create, and the
Membership Rights do not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power
on the part of a Member to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise
act on behalf of the Trust or any other Member, to bind the Trust or any other
Member to any Contract or Liability or to Convey any Property or any asset, right or
property owned or held by or on behalf of the Trust or any Member. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no Member shall be deemed the partner of the Trust or
any other Member. No Member shall state, purport, imply, hold out or represent
to any person that such Member or any other Member has any such authority,
right or power.
(d) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no Member shall be (or shall
be deemed to be) Liable for any Liability of the Trust or any other Trust Member. This clause
“(d)” shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of the Trust or any
Member to indemnify or compensate any Trust Member from, or hold any
Member harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such Member under any
applicable law, in connection with the Member’s participation in the Trust or otherwise.
IV. BINDING EFFECT OF THE DESIGNATED SMART CONTRACT
(a) General Binding Effect.
(i) Smart Contract Deference. Except as set forth in Section 4(b):
(A) the results of operation of the Designated Smart Contract and
Cryptographic Consensus shall be determinative of the rights and obligations of, and
shall be final, binding upon and non-appealable by, each of the Members with
respect to the Trust Purposes, the Trust Shares, the Trust Property and the
Distributed Trust Property (the “Trust Matters”);
(B) each Trust Member has the unconditional right to take any action or
exercise any right, power or privilege that is possible to be taken or exercised by a
Trust Member with a Cryptographic Units or by interacting with the Designated
Smart Contract, including transferring Cryptographic Units (to the extent the
Designated Smart Contract permits such transfers), calling any function of the
Designated Smart Contract, Conveying any Token to the Designated Smart Contract
or receiving any Token from the Designated Smart Contract;
(C) no Trust Member has any duties or responsibilities to make any particular
use of the Cryptographic Units or interact with the Designated Smart Contract at all or
in any particular way; provided, however, that this clause “(C)” does not and shall not
be deemed to limit any other provision of this Charter, including the requirement set
forth in the preceding clause “(A)” that a Member shall be bound by the results
of operations of the Designated Smart Contract.
(ii) Smart Contract Preempts Contrary Legal Contracts. Except as set forth in
Section 4(b), if in connection with any Trust Matters there is any conflict or inconsistency
between: (A)(1) this Charter or (2) any other Contract between or among any Members;
and (B) any Contract created or implied by, or embodied in, the machine, assembly or other
code, or the results of operation, of the Designated Smart Contract, then the Contract referred
to in the preceding clause “(B)” shall prevail over the Contract referred to in the preceding
clause “(A).” Notwithstanding the foregoing, particular Members may opt out of this
Section 4(a)(ii), solely as to themselves and without any adverse effect on other
Members, to the extent expressly provided in a written legal agreement, provided that the
execution of such agreement is announced to all Members and an accurate and
complete copy of such agreement is made readily available to all Members.
(iii) Prohibition of Legal Proceedings &amp; Transfers. No Member shall, without
the prior written unanimous consent of the other Members or as otherwise permitted by
the Designated Smart Contract, directly or indirectly take or attempt to take any of the
following actions:
(A) except as set forth in Section 4(b) or to the extent necessary to enforce the
express provisions of this Charter, commence or continue any Legal Proceeding,
assert any Claim or enforce any judgment or other Order, in each case, that (1) is
against or involves any other Member(s), (2) relates to this Charter or the
matters contemplated by this Charter, the Designated Smart Contract, the
Property or any of the other Trust Matters, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Legal Proceeding or Order in rem pertaining to the Trust Property or any Legal
Proceeding or Claim challenging the enforceability of any provision of this Charter;
(B) Convey any of the Trust Property other than such Member’s
Distributed Trust Property (it being understood that for a Member to “Convey”
any of the Trust Property means for such Member to, or to enter into any
Contract that may obligate such Member, any other Member or the Trust
to: (1) create, perfect or enforce any Lien on, (2) pledge, hypothecate, grant an option
or derivative security, swap or other instrument with respect to or (3) convey, sell,
transfer or dispose of such Trust Property or any right or interest of the Trist or any
Member to or in such Trust Property); or
(C) cause, assist, encourage or facilitate, a Material Adverse Exception Event.
(b) Exception Handling. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4(a),
if there is a Material Adverse Exception Event, then the rules and procedures set forth in this
clause “(b)” shall determine the rights and obligations of the Trust Members relating to the
Trust Property.
(i) Exception Notice. If any Member becomes aware that there is a Material
Adverse Exception Event, such Member (the “Sending Member”) shall deliver to the
other Members (the “Receiving Members”) a notice (an “Exception Notice”):
(A) certifying that the Sending Member believes in good faith that there is a
Material Adverse Exception Event;
(B) describing in reasonable detail the events, facts, circumstances and reasons
forming the basis of such belief;
(C) if and only if desired, describing in reasonable detail a proposal by such
Member of the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the
remedies to be sought by the Members in response to the Material Adverse
Exception Event an “Exception Handling Proposal”;
(D) including copies of any written evidence or other material written
information, and summaries of any other evidence, relevant to, and material for the
consideration of, the Material Adverse Exception Event and the other matters referred
to in the Exception Notice; and
(E) containing a representation by the Sending Member, made to and for the
benefit of the Receiving Members with the understanding that the Receiving
Members will rely thereon, that, to the Sending Member’s knowledge, the
certification and statements made pursuant to the preceding clauses “(A)” and “(B)”
are accurate as of the date of the Exception Notice, and, considered collectively, do
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make such statements, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading.
(ii) Exception Standstill. During the period starting on the date of delivery of an
Exception Notice and ending with the Members entering into an Exception Handling
Addendum or receiving a final decision of an arbitrator in accordance with Section 4(b)(iii)
(the “Standstill Period”), each Member shall: (A) treat all of the Distributed Trust
Property of such Member that may have been Transferred to such Member as a
result of the Material Adverse Exception Event as if it were Trust Property, including by
disregarding the parenthetical exceptions for Distributed Trust Property in Section 4(a)(iii);
and (B) deposit and maintain such Distributed Trust Property in a segregated Account
Address to be treated, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, as a
custodial trust held for the benefit of the Members.
(iii) Determination of Exception Handling.
(A) The term “Exception Handling Addendum” refers to an addendum to this
Charter setting forth the Members’ agreement on the existence or non-existence
of a Material Adverse Exception Event and the actions to be taken, the agreements to
be entered into, and the remedies to be sought in response thereto. Each Exception
Handling Addendum shall automatically and without further action of the Trust
Members be deemed incorporated into and to form a part of this Charter.
(B) During the continuous 10-day period beginning on the date of delivery of
the Exception Notice (the “Negotiation Period”), the Members shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith to agree upon the existence
or non-existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event and, if so agreed, the actions
to be taken, the agreements to be entered into and the remedies to be sought by the
Members in response to the Material Adverse Exception Event. If the
Members agree upon such matters during the Negotiation Period, the Members
shall promptly enter into an Exception Handling Addendum reflecting the same.
(C) If the Trust Members fail to reach an agreement resulting in an Exception
Handling Addendum during the Negotiation Period, then either Member may
initiate an arbitration action to resolve the issues in accordance with the procedures
set forth at <a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf</a> (the
“Arbitration Procedures”). The decision resulting from the Arbitration Procedures
shall include, among any other determinations, a determination of the treatment of any
Distributed Trust Property and whether to extend, modify or terminate the covenants
applying to the Distributed Trust Property during the Standstill Period. The decision
resulting from the Arbitration Procedures shall be non- appealable, binding and
conclusive upon the Members. Judgment upon such a decision may be entered
in any court of competent jurisdiction.

made by or on behalf of the other DAO Member in determining to enter into or perform this
Charter or otherwise making any evaluation or determination of the Designated Smart
Contract or any other matter contemplated by this Charter. The Representing DAO Member
understands that the other DAO Member has not made, and has not authorized any of its
